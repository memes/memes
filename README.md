# Hello!

I'm a Cloud Solutions Architect at F5 on the Cloud Alliances team specialising in GCP. You can probably find me on one of F5's Community Slack<sup>1</sup> channels if needed.

If you are looking for an obsolete [mutt](http://www.mutt.org/) config or unmaintained AMI generator written in BASH you are in luck too. Bonus points if you find and recognise the RCS tags sprinkled in some of the older cruft.

I occassionally tweet [@matthewemes](https://twitter.com/matthewemes), and on rare occasions I post to [matthewemes.com](https://matthewemes.com/). Life's too short to document everything.
